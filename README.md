#### Commands (for instance : ubuntu os)
- There are a lot of situation where we wanna upload a file such as `JPEG,GIF,VIDEO,PDF,WORD,...`
    to our server and we have to use third party uploader/downloader in case to achieve this goal.
    with this repository , you can use your own uploader/downloader and upload and download medias
    with your `java` `application`.
