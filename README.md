### mirbozorgi_local_uploader

- There are a lot of situation where we wanna upload a file such as `JPEG,GIF,VIDEO,PDF,WORD,...`
    to our server and we have to use third party uploader/downloader in case to achieve this goal.
    with this repository , you can use your own uploader/downloader and upload and download medias
    with your `java` `application`.

- You can find the api documentation from this url : `http://localhost:8052/swagger-ui.html#/`
